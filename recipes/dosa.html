    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>  
        <li>Urad dal (black gram split lentils)</li>  
        <li>Fenugreek seeds</li>  
        <li>Water</li>  
        <li>Salt</li>  
        <li>Oil or ghee (for cooking)</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and soak the rice and urad dal (along with fenugreek seeds) in water for about 6-8 hours or overnight.</li>  
        <li>Drain the soaked ingredients and grind them together with a little water to form a smooth, thick batter. Allow the batter to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours.</li>  
        <li>Once fermented, stir the batter and add salt to taste.</li>  
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or dosa pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil or ghee.</li>  
        <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan and spread it out in a thin, circular motion to form a dosa.</li>  
        <li>Cook until the edges start to lift and the bottom is golden brown and crispy. Optionally, you can drizzle a bit of oil or ghee around the edges for extra crispiness.</li>  
        <li>Flip the dosa and cook for an additional minute if you prefer a crispier texture.</li>  
        <li>Remove the dosa from the pan and serve hot with chutneys and sambar.</li>
    </ol>
